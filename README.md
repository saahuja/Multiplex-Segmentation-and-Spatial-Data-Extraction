Make sure when running the default to download the .jpg images from the /notebooks/Multiplex Tissue-Segmentation Model/15_T_BC180x2_[46585, 10362]/ folder into your local folder. Specifically:

CD3_1.jpg, CD68_1.jpg, CD8_1.jpg, CK_1.jpg, DAPI_1.jpg, PD_L1_1.jpg

However, this can be obviously directly changed for the FOV being analyzed.
